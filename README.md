## Special Notes

- Unity is sometimes very picky about config files which has caused us a few issues throughout the development of this project. Because of that we have had to work across some different repos and branches. This means that commit history will be a little hard to find in all of one place. We have included a link to another repo we have worked on if you guys are interested in seeing that stuff. All code for the final deliverable is on this repo so no need to go to the repo linked below unless you are interested in more detailed commit history. https://github.com/Object-Oriented-Analysis-and-Design/Dungeon-Delver-GameProject
- If for some reason the project isn't compiling for you guys, please reach out to us or view our demo video to see the working game. All scripts can be opened without Unity if you are interested in seeing the code alone. We are hoping there aren't any issues with compatibility but we have randomly been seeing conflict errors with the library files across different commits, but we believe this should be sorted out especially if you are pulling fresh from the repo. 
- Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns!
